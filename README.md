Hello Reader! 

My name is Bennett Lovejoy. I'm accidentally a software programmer and now a website developer. 
All I wanted to do was make a map of the median income of my community. 
Now I'm making a website piece by piece to host said map. 

I could've drawn a map by hand faster. 

But that's okay! Good things take time.

Here are my files. 

1. If you click on the file labeled "index.html" a window will open
  in your browser where you will be able to see my website.

2. All of the other folders and files contain the content on said website.

3. Please feel free to explore! If you develop questions,
   find problems, or just want to send me encouragement,
   reach out to me at lovejoybennett@gmail.com
